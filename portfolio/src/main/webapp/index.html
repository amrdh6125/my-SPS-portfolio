              <h2>About me!: </h2>
              <p>
                  I was born on July 5th, 2001 in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. 
                  I am currently enrolled in the Inter American University of Puerto Rico - Bayamon Campus.
                  I got into Computer Engineering through my love for video games.
                  I've been playing video games since I was little, and that gave my dream to become a game developer.
                  When the time to go to college came, not many universities in Puerto Rico offered game developing classes.
                  Because of this, I chose to take a Computer Engineering which seemed to be close to my main career choice.
                  I am currently enjoying Computer Engineering and I feel like I might be falling in love with it too!
